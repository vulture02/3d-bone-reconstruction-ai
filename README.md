# 3D Bone Reconstruction AI 🦴🤖

This project leverages deep learning and computer vision to perform **3D reconstruction of human bones from DICOM (CT scan) data**. It utilizes medical imaging techniques, 3D surface generation, and AI models to visualize and reconstruct bone structures with precision.

## 💡 Features

- 📦 Load and process DICOM medical imaging data
- 🧠 Use AI models to reconstruct 3D bone surfaces
- 🖼️ Generate 3D mesh and visualization of bones
- ⚙️ Simple UI for uploading and rendering
- 🧪 Designed for research, educational, or assistive medical applications

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy / SciPy / OpenCV
- VTK / PyVista / Matplotlib
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for AI models)
- Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation
- DICOM handling via `pydicom`
